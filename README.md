# Bring Back Slack UI
In Fall 2023, Slack received a UI update which removed the ability to customize theming using the 8-property colour schemes. This project aims to bring it back!

The colour schemes involved the following properties:
- Column BG
- Menu BG Hover
- Active Item
- Active Item Text
- Hover Item
- Text Color
- Active Presence
- Mention badge

## Project Status
This project is currently a work-in-progress, please check back soon for updates!

### Current
I am working through writing the CSS to colour the individual elements.

### Future Plans
This is a blur for me right now but here are some thoughts on what I might do:
- Browser extension for Slack web
- Custom Slack Desktop app using something like [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) or something still being worked on
- CSS injections like what [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord) for theming the Discord electron client
